This is a repository with two branches: master and greeting.
The greeting.txt file contains my favorite greeting.
The branch greeting added the greeting to the file and added the file to the staging area and commited.
I switched back to the master branch and created a this ReadMe file, added it to the staging area and commited.
The repository contains another file called answer9.txt that explains the output of the command "git log --oneline --graph --all".
At the end I merged the greeting branch into the master branch.
