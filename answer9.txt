What is the output of "git log --oneline --graph --all" command?

The command shows the commit logs for all the existing branches.
The output of the command shows that there are two commits one for the master branch and one for the greeting branch that still not pushed.
The text in the parenthesis indicates the branches and the HEAD pointer indicates the working branch, in our case it is the naster.
The command shows that the master branch is in the same point of the remote branch (origin/master) but the greeting branch isn't in
the same point of the remote branch because we didn't push our commit.
